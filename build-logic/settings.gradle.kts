     * The dependencyResolutionManagement { repositories {...}}* block is where you configure the repositories and dependencies used by

     * create your application. However, you should configure module-specific
     * dependencies in each module-level build.gradle.kts file. For new projects,
     * Android Studio includes Google's Maven repository and the
     * Maven Central Repository by
     * default, but it does not configure any dependencies (unless you select a
     * template that requires some).
